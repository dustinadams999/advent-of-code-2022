# advent-of-code-2022
Follow along as we jingle our way through the Advent of Code!

I will organize each day's solutions into its corresponding *dayN* folder. Each
day should have part1.py, and part2.py...assuming I was able to complete it
:grin:.

You can run each script in its directory by doing:
```
python part1.py <input-file>
```

If you publish any of this code, please cite it, you don't want to get coal for
Christmas, Santa ain't playin' around this year.
